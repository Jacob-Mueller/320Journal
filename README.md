•	How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
•	How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
•	How do I approach designing software?\n
Running the code after adding new sections, and constructing tests and running them after running the code to make sure everything compiles ensures that a project is functional and secure. User needs can be taken from the project planning stage or found online from similar projects if not included in the project requirements; many online video games have similar login setups for instance. Taking the time to have all the tests mirror the code is a great way to design the software, I found myself getting more comfortable with setting my parameters with the “or” (||) rather than writing out a mess of “if” statements. Putting efficiency and readability first is my new approach to designing software.
